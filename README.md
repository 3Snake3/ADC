This mod adds a lot of additional content, like:
Turrets.
Several lines of units.
Improved versions of vanilla plants.
Factories for new items.
Factories of expensive vanilla items that can only be dug up with drills.
Some vanilla turrets use my new items as ammunition.
Also includes status effects, liquids, walls, a couple of which have special features.
This mod is not complete without generators.
